# Dybo Hardware Project Overview

This is the place focused on developing detailed specifications and prototyping for the hardware components of the Dybo ecosystem.

## Project Objectives

### Hardware Specifications

- **Processor.** Recommendations for ARM-based processors suitable for educational tasks.
- **Memory.** Optimal RAM configurations for efficient multitasking and performance.
- **Storage.** Suitable storage solutions (e.g., eMMC, SD cards) to ensure sufficient space for educational applications and data.
- **Display.** Specifications for high-resolution and affordable touchscreens that support stylus input. 4096 levels of sensitivity to pressure is likely unnecessary.
- **Battery.** Durable, long-lasting cylindrical batteries.

### Rapid Prototyping Using Off-the-Shelf Components
_The Interim Dybo_

Utilize readily available components to create an interim Dybo prototype. This will allow for quick testing and iteration of designs before finalizing specifications.

- **Modular Design.** Create a modular prototype using popular components, such as:
  - Raspberry Pi as the core processing unit.
  - Standard touchscreen displays from manufacturers like Adafruit or SparkFun.
  - Off-the-shelf stylus pens compatible with capacitive touchscreens.
  - Battery packs from electronics suppliers for testing power management and longevity.
- **Integration Testing.** Conduct integration tests with DyboOS to assess the compatibility and performance of the prototype in real educational scenarios.


### Repairable

- **Design for Repair.** Modular and easily disassembled hardware to allow simple repairs and upgrades:
 - **Easily Accessible Components.** Ensure critical components like the battery, display, and ports can be accessed and replaced with minimal tools.
 - **Clear Documentation.** Provide comprehensive guides and diagrams to assist users in performing repairs, promoting self-sufficiency and reducing e-waste.
 - **Standardized Parts.** Utilize standardized components wherever possible to make replacements easy and inexpensive.
 - **Sustainable Materials.** Promote sustainability through the use of the appropriate materials, encouraging a culture of reusing and recycling.

Dybo Hardware aims to establish a solid foundation for the Dybo educational tablet ecosystem. Join us in building a better educational future!
